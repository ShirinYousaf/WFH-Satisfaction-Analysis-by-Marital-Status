# WFH-Satisfaction-Analysis-by-Marital-Status

As remote work becomes a permanent fixture in the modern workplace, organizations are increasingly focused on understanding what drives employee satisfaction in work-from-home settings. This project investigates whether marital status plays a role in shaping job satisfaction among remote employees. Using data from a randomized control trial, we apply regression analysis to explore the relationship between marital status and satisfaction while controlling for key variables such as workspace conditions, gender, income, and tenure. The goal is to generate insights that can support more informed HR strategies for managing remote and hybrid workforces.
